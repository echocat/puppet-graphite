# Module graphite

This module installs and makes basic configs for graphite, with carbon and whisper.

# Tested on
RHEL/CentOS/Scientific 6+
Debian 6+
Ubunutu 10.04 and newer

# Requirements:

Configure conf files as you need:

templates/opt/graphite/conf/storage-schemas.conf.erb
templates/opt/graphite/webapp/graphite/local_settings.py.erb

### Modules needed:

stdlib by puppetlabs

### Software versions needed:
facter > 1.6.2
puppet > 2.6.2

On Redhat distributions you need the EPEL or RPMforge repository, because Graphite needs packages, which are not part of the default repos.

# Sample usage:

### Out of the box graphite installation

node "graphite.my.domain" {
        include graphite
}

### Tuned graphite installation

  # This carbon cache will accept TCP and UDP datas and
  # the cachesize is limited to 256mb
node "graphite.my.domain" {
	class {'graphite':
		gr_max_cache_size => 256,
		gr_enable_udp_listener => True
	}
}

## Optional

### Move Apache to alternative ports:

The default puppet set up won't work if you have an existing web server in
place. In my case this was Nginx. For me moving apache off to another port was
good enough. To allow this you do

  # Move apache to alternate HTTP/HTTPS ports:
node "graphite.my.domain" {
    class {'graphite':
        gr_apache_port => 2080,
        gr_apache_port_https => 2443,
    }
}
